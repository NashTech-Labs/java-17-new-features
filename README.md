# Java 17 New Features

In this repository, we will cover all features that have been added after JDK 8, with a focus on JDK 17.


## JDK 17


### 1. Pattern Matching 
Pattern matching simplifies type checks and casts in conditional statements, making code more concise and readable.

#### Pattern Matching for Switch vs. instanceof Checks
#### Java 17:
Introduced pattern matching for switch statements, allowing more concise and readable code. This eliminates the need for explicit casts (instanceof checks) and makes the code more type-safe.
##### Previous Versions:
Required the use of instanceof checks followed by explicit casting, which could lead to boilerplate code and potential runtime errors if not handled properly.


### 2. Sealed Class

##### Java 17:
Introduced sealed classes which restrict the hierarchy of subclasses that can extend/implement the sealed class or interface. This provides better control over class hierarchies and improves code safety.
##### Previous Versions:
Used traditional interfaces without the ability to restrict which classes could implement them.

### 3. Stream API Improvements
Java 17 includes enhancements to the Stream API, such as new methods for efficient and concise stream processing.


### 4. Records

Records provide a concise way to declare classes that are transparent holders for immutable data. Let's compare how you would define a record in Java 17 versus using a traditional class in Java 11.


### Conclusion
Java 17's new features such as sealed classes and pattern matching for switch statements significantly improve code readability, maintainability, and safety compared to previous Java versions. Sealed classes enforce stricter class hierarchies, while pattern matching simplifies code that deals with type-specific behavior, reducing boilerplate code and potential bugs. These improvements make Java 17 a more powerful and developer-friendly language for modern application development.### HttpClient
